# Seed
This is the Seed application for all new angular projects in the sbsc front-end team. After pulling this, ensure that you change the application name from Seed to what your own application will be called in the package.json folder. 

The Seed has been setup to make Heroku deployments seamless as the node server enviroment has been bootstrap to it. 

If you have any question, please contact the Team Lead.
